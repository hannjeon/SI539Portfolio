			 			<h3>MY ROLE</h3>
			 			<p>One of the largest wealth management firms in the U.S., UBS collaborated with Deloitte to launch an entirely redesigned Financial Services iPhone app. As part of this redesign project team, I designed banking features for the app.</p>

			 			<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
			 			<p>UBS wanted to bring more awareness of the banking services offered to their clients.
			 			</p> 

			 		</div>
			 		<div class="col-md-5">
			 			<h3>THE OUTCOME</h3>
			 			<p>We launched a banking hub page in the UBS Financial Services app, which is called “at a glance” under the banking services in the navigation. At a glance page is the one stop place where a user can manage cash-related tasks and view their total cash value; view recent activity, manage upcoming payments and transfers, etc. <br><span> Redesigned UBS Financial Service app increased user engagement metrics and positive reviews for over 95K users</span></p>

			 		<h4>DESIGN BRIEF</h4>
			 			<p>UBS wanted to enhance their clients’ digital experience since the clients were lacking self-service tools to plan for their financial future. Deloitte and UBS worked together for this mission, and launched an iPad app in March of 2019. Using this groundwork, Deloitte pushed the experience to include additional tools and features for an enhanced iPhone release. One of the new features was a banking hub where the clients could manage their banking related items efficiently.  <br><br>On the banking hub page, called At A Glance, a user could:<br>
							1. Gain a comprehensive view of their cash across institutions <br>
							2. View upcoming payments & transfers <br>
							3. View recent cash & credit activity <br>
							4. Manage their credit cards <br>
							5. Transfer funds into a savings program </p>

						<h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>

						<h5>01. Research</h5>
						<h6>Generative Research</h6>
						<p>UBS and Deloitte conducted qualitative research on how their clients view and manage their cash as part of their wealth management. Based on this research, they came up with some features for cash management and conducted testing to validate their concept.<br><br>

						From this research and testing, we learned that there is a strong mental divide between cash for everyday transactions, and “savings & investment” (short-term needs vs. long-term needs). In addition, some participants for the testing expressed confusion over what the exact offering was and what about UBS made it different from a typical bank account.

						<h6>Competitive Analysis and Current Experience Audit</h6>
						<p>We conducted a competitive analysis to see how they positioned cash related services or programs within their product, and what kind of cash management tools and features they have. <br><br>

						From this analysis, we learned that segmenting financial needs in three different categories made most sense: investment, loan, and cash.  However, we found that the current UBS app put cash in a different category: cash balances and activities are placed in the investment section.</p>

						<h5>02. Ideation</h5>
						<h6>Information Architecture</h6>
						<p>After conducting this research, we built new information architecture to put cash management features in the right place within the UBS app in order to match it to a user’s mental model based on what we learned from the research. One of the changes we proposed was restructuring the Accounts section. Dividing sections into three different categories in financial needs: Investments, Cash, and Liabilities. <br><br>

						With new information architecture, we also demonstrated an ideal view of the home dashboard and navigation.

			 		<h6>Define the scope for MVP</h6>
						<p>Although UBS agreed that our proposal was ideal, they wanted to minimize the restructuring of the current app because it would impact the timeline and cost of development. Instead of restructuring the app, <span>we decided to have a separate experience under the banking services section,</span> consisting of one page aggregating cash management related features. We also decided to add a component on the dashboard so that a user can check their cash in hand and can go to this cash management feature aggregated page easily.

						</p><br>

				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
						<h5>03. Define Concept</h5>
						<h6>Feature ideation and exploring layout</h6>
						<p>Main features that came out from the generative research phase were: total cash view, target cash level setting, banking offering, and upcoming bills & transfers. Additionally, we brainstormed more about helpful features and thought about information hierarchy within the page.
						</p>

					<h6>Design iteration with technical feasibility and business requirements</h6>
						<p>While iterating design, we had several meetings to gather technical feasibility and business requirements. Then, the design was adjusted based on these considerations: <br>
						1) UBS wants to make this page much broader than cash management to embrace banking. <br>
						2) Some features could not be implemented for MVP because of technical issues, or business requirements. 
 					</p>
 					<br>
 					<h6>Layout exploration</h6>
						<p>With required features, we explored different layouts to make the page easy to scan and digest. The biggest design challenge for this page came from the total cash section on top of the page: how can we show categorized numbers clearly in the limited space on the page? For example, total cash consists of UBS accounts and external accounts, and the amount of UBS accounts consists of the amount of cash available and cash alternative. Plus, we also had to display how many accounts made this total amount of cash. Since there is a lot of information and numbers were tied into one data point, total cash, it was a challenge to clearly display this hierarchy so that a user could get the information they are looking for easily and quickly. In order to achieve this, we explored different layouts.

						<h5>04. Design iteration and usertesting</h5>
						<h6>Design Iteration</h6>
						<p>While we had designed this banking hub experience at one page (Design A); displaying all the information for cash and credits, we strongly felt that it should be separated into different pages: cash vs. credit because we believed it would match more with the user’s mental model. Also, we wanted to make these pages easy to scan by showing only high level information at first (Design B).

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><br>
					<h6>1:1 in-person usertesting</h6>
						<p>We conducted 1:1 in-person user testing with 10 participants to validate which version of design would more resonate with them, and to get feedback on improving the design for each feature.<br><br>

						From this testing, we found that most participants preferred the immediate representation of information in version B, but the majority wanted some sort of combination of version A & B. Most also appreciated the summary view for recent cash & credit activity.<br><br>

						With the result of user testing, we had several discussions with the UBS team, then we finalized our design for mobile. <span>Due to time and technical constraints, we had to keep the design A approach, but we could enhance the experience of this page by adding a summary view for some components.</span>

						<p>Based on the finalized mobile design, we moved forward to design the other form factors: iPad and desktop web versions for the banking hub.

						<p>Based on wireframes I worked on, a UI designer in the team produced final screens and design assets so that developers on the UBS team could build the page.

						<h4>IMPACT AND REFLECTION</h4>
						<p>The UBS Financial Services iOS mobile app was launched in December 2019, including the banking hub experience. This revamped app significantly increased digital engagement among UBS clients, and this app was recognized as “intuitive, easily accessible, and modern” by users. Especially for the banking hub, we could hear that users loved the summary view of upcoming payments & transfers and recent cash & credit activity because they found that it was useful for checking  their banking related activities.<br><br>

						Although we couldn’t completely implement the ideal state of the banking experience into the MVP version due to several design constraints, our findings and design ideas are still valid. Based on this fact, UBS and the Deloitte team have continued to make an effort to enhance the banking experience.
