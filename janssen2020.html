			 		<h4>DESIGN BRIEF</h4>
			 			<p>Global Trial Community (GTC) is a clinical patient portal for Janssen, where patients in a clinical trial, caregivers, or significant others of the patients could see or share their clinical trial information. In total, we produced 36 responsive web-based screens for MVP launch. This portal will be used by 10 different languages in 10 different countries.<br><br>

						Following are the main features of the GTC, and all of them were discovered and defined through extensive research:<br>
						1. Clinical trial data check<br>
						2. Visit reminder<br>
						3. Clinical trial status tracker <br>
						4. Disease or clinical trial updates

						<h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>

						<h5>01. Research</h5>
						<h6>Understanding a User</h6>
						<p>We absorbed the results of qualitative research on clinical trial patients’ experience in different diseases. We focused on understanding the user’s needs and frustrations during clinical trial participation. We learned that patients’ experience and their goals different based on which phase they are in during the trial: pre-trial, during the trial, and post-trial.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><br>
						<h6>Client Workshop</h6>
						<p>Next, we conducted an empathy map, journey map, dot voting during a workshop with the clients to build empathy, and identified pain points and opportunities that would be translated to features in the patient portal when going through a clinical trial process.

						<h6>Synthesizing</h6>
						<p>Through our syntheses, we learned one of the frustrations of a patient was feeling abandoned once their trial is done because they couldn’t hear any study updates or results. Since contributing to the study is one of their motivations for participating in a clinical trial, it made them disappointed. Additionally, we learned some more opportunities that we could improve patients’ experience through GTC. Below are outputs from the client workshop and synthesizing.</p>

						<h5>02. Ideation</h5>
						<h6>Story Board & POC Wireframes</h6>
						<p>Empowered by our research, we decided to kick off ideation of the GTC. We didn’t consider any constraints during brainstorming ideal features for GTC. Examples of feature ideas were a visit tracker, visit reminder, and study summary for post-trial patients. <br><br>

						Then we created a storyboard to show how the features could enhance a user’s experience over the major touch points which a user interacts within the portal. Also, we produced proof of concept (POC) screens to quickly verify how these ideal features could sit on the screen before diving into the design details of the portal.

			 		<h6>Brainstorming with design considerations</h6>
						<p>To translate our idea into digital experience in reality, we had more brainstorming sessions with whiteboard, pen and paper. We also had a couple of meetings with a developer and the client to figure out technical feasibilities as well as to take business requirements.

						<h5>03. Refine the ideas</h5>
						<h6>Site map, User flow, and Wireframes</h6>
						<p>We started to think about screen level design. We focused more on elements in the screens, and interactions and flows between the screens. In this process, we produced a site map, user flows, and wireframes to communicate with clients and to make design decisions.

					<br><br>
					<h6>Wireframes</h6>
						<p>I made an effort to carry user research results and ideas from brainstorming to our actual design. For example, we decided to design a dynamic dashboard depending on a patient’s trial status because the user’s needs or information they are looking for varies depending on which phase they are in. In addition, we designed a page dedicated to trial study information and updates, so that patients would not feel abandoned and could keep seeing their contribution beyond their participation. Below are examples of wireframes.<br>

				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><br><br>
						<h5>04. Final Deliverable</h5>
						<h6>UI Design</h6>
						<p>Once wireframes are signed off, a UI designer translated my wireframes into mockup screens after taking Janssen’s brand guideline into account. These screens were our final deliverable to the client, and developers started to build the portal based on these screens.
						</p>

						<h4>IMPACT AND REFLECTION</h4>
						<p>Once we finished producing design assets, we handed off to a development team on the client-side. As of January 2020, the site development was still in progress. After we handed off, the client leveraged another resource from Deloitte, Pixel UserTesting. They could collect anonymous feedback from real users on the portal design and the comments we received were extremely positive. <br><br>

						Since I had no clinical trials experience before, it was challenging for me to understand a user’s emotions and their thoughts. Decent solutions don’t come out from just simply understanding a list of a user’s frustrations or their needs. A designer should be in their context and fully understand the user’s mind on each touchpoint of the product, then try to apply that insight in design. From this project, I learned different methods for building empathy for an unfamiliar user type. One of the good methods I found was using a story. Reading or listening to a user’s story, regardless of if it is related to a product, is a very powerful way to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a user. Of course the best way to understand a user is having the same experience, however, I found that indirect experience is still valid, and I would leverage the methods that I learned from this project for future projects as well.
