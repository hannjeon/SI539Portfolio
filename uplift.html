			 			<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
			 			<p>More than 66,000 households in Detroit don’t have access to a vehicle. Poor transit access is linked to unemployment, low income, and low economic mobility. Public transportation is one of the most commonly used forms of transportation because of its accessibility and affordability. However, we have observed that public transportation isn’t meeting the traveling needs of the low-income community members, which is limiting their access to basic necessities such as healthcare, education, employment, and food.<span> How might we improve so that our product is more successful based on improving the low income community members’ access to mobility?</span></p>

			 		</div>
			 		<div class="col-md-4">
			 			<h3>THE OUTCOME</h3>
			 			<p>Uplift is a ride-sharing app that matches community service volunteers with low-income community members who need transportation to access various goods and services such as healthcare, grocery shopping, education, and employment. The app will enable non-profit organizations to coordinate ride requests by automatically pairing requests with volunteers and generating a ride schedule based on driver availability.</p><br>

			 			<h4>DESIGN BRIEF</h4>
			 				<p>Uplift is for <span>enabling low-income community members who need transportation to use ride sharing service without giving financial burden.</span> This system would match volunteer drivers who is registered under non-profit organizations and ride requesters. The driver would pick up and drop off the passengers who requested a ride. </p>

			 		<h5>Key features of Uplift (Driver)</h5>
			 			<h6>01. Automatic Ride Scheduling</h6>
						<p>Once the ride requests are submitted to Uplift, the system will automatically generate a ride schedule by matching requests with volunteers (drivers) who are available during the requested pick-up time and location.</p><br>

						<h6>02. Display of Ride Requests & Driver Settings</h6>
						<p>The ride request information is displayed in a map or list view on the driver’s mobile device. The drivers are able to view all the ride requests that match their availability, and select the requests of their choice.</p><br>

						<h6>03. Ride Notification and Direct Route Guidance</h6>
						<p>After drivers accept the ride requests, the system will send automated notifications to both riders and drivers, which contain information about their pick-up time and location. The driver notification will include a link or widget that launches the driver’s mobile navigation app and start route guidance to the requested destination.</p><br>

						<h6>04. Driver Safety Feature</h6>
						<p>When there is a safety concern, the drivers can call out a pre-programmed secret wake-up word (ex. “Apple”), which will trigger their device’s voice recognition system to start recording audio and send the driver’s GPS location to the nearest police office.

						<h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>

						<h5>01. Framing the Problem</h5>
						<h6>Background Research</h6>
						<p>Before we jumped into the user research, we conducted background research. In this step, we could have a better understanding about mobility issues for low-income individuals and what kind of actions exist to tackle down those issues.
						</p><br>

						<h6>User Research</h6>
						<p>The aim of this project is to identify the limitations of public transportation as a main transportation and to propose an alternative or improved means of reliable transportation for low-income people using affordable information technology. Our <span>interviews with the United Way, Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT), and a social impact entrepreneur </span>revealed the profile of low-income community members, public transit systems, and the current limitations in Michigan. Then, we investigated the factors of negative experience on public transportation through our <span>interviews with the passengers at Rosa Parks Transit Center</span> and the observation of the environment.</p>

						<br><br>
						<h5>02. Finding a good solution</h5>
						<h6>Brainstorming with sketching</h6>
						<p>We brainstormed possible solutions by sketching ideas. Our first idea was to use public transportation cards’ remaining balances as donation fees. This idea originated from the London Oyster Card, which we decided to modify for the U.S context. The remaining money would go to low-income individuals who need transportation fares for his or her daily commuting.
						</p><br>
						<h6>Survey, Personas, and User Scenario</h6>
						<p>
						To understand donation and public transportation behavior, we surveyed 30 transit users. Based on collected data, we created personas and their user scenario to develop a refined solution.
						</p><br>

			 		<p class="caption">Survey questions and User scenario </p>
					<br><br>					
				

						<h5>03. Refining the solution (iterative design)</h5>
						<p>Although we started to design parts of our remaining balance donation system idea, we decided to change our solution because a donation system could only solve the 'public transportation fare' problem, but not our target audiences' other needs, such as their long transportation times.  <br><br>

						We decided to define a ride-sharing service as our solution. In this step, we brainstormed what features this application should have and what kind of technology is accessible for two different target users. We decided to use a mobile app technology tool for volunteer drivers and a website and text messaging system for low-income community members. We wanted to make our design as accessible as possible, including those who have very limited data plans.

					<h5>04. Prototyping</h5>
					<h6>Digital Prototyping</h6>
						<p>After going through another brainstorming phase (Sketch, User Scenario) and building wireframes, we created a digital prototype.

			 		<p class="caption">Screenshot of digital prototype interfaces (Adobe XD)</p><br>
					
				<h6>Usability Test</h6>
					<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our service and its value proposition, we conducted usability testing with target audiences (drivers).<br>
					The usability testing participants expressed concerns or curiosities about the methods of a passenger verification, and reward for drivers during the follow-up interviews. Another detailed comment on the specific features are about displaying a map of final route with pins that indicate the locations of stops or the passengers. There was also a new idea of the beacon stickers that can be detected via a mobile application, which may improve accessibility of the service for passengers with disabilities when tracking the location of their rides on the street. Through the usability testing of our service, we were able to improve our interface designs.</p>

						<h4>OVERALL IMPACT</h4>
						<p>Uplift enhances transportation equity for low-income individuals in following ways:<br>
						• Low-income people can use a ride sharing service without undue financial burden (same amount as a public transit fare), unlike existing ride sharing services.<br>
						• Low-income people may experience better trasnportation service by less waiting and traveling time compared to public transportation.<br>
						• Ultimately Uplift would reduce unemployment rate and improve healthcare, schooling, and economic situation of lower-income communities.
