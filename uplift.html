			<h1>Uplift: Commuter-to-Commuter Ridesharing Service for low-income employees</h1>

			 			<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
			 			<p><span>Due to limited resources, low-income community members find challenges in accessing transportation for their employment that requires regular visits.</span> Public transportation is one of the most commonly used forms of transportation because of its accessibility and affordability. However, it has significant problems of unreliable bus schedules, disintegrated networks of transit systems, disrespectful behaviors of other passengers, and long wait time. Our team focused on these issues on Detroit, MI.</p>
			 		</div>
			 		<div class="col-md-4">
			 			<h3>THE OUTCOME</h3>
			 			<p>Our team introduced how the commuter-to-commuter ridesharing service called Uplift that automatically creates the tailored route for the users in proximity based on their preferences in distance or time, can enhance their experience of commute and improve the community’s accessibility to mobility. Outcome was proposed through paper, poster and video.</p><br>

			 			<h4>DESIGN BRIEF</h4>
			 				<p>Uplift is for <span>enabling low-income commuters to use ride sharing service without giving financial burden.</span> This system would match commuters who have similar commuting route. <br>The driver would pick up and drop off the passengers who requested a ride. Since the accessibility to technology for two target users are different, they would use different tool.

						<h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>

						<h5>01. Framing the Problem</h5>
						<h6>Background Research</h6>
						<p>Before we jumped into the user research, we conducted background research. In this step, we could have a better understanding about mobility issues for low-income community and what kind of actions exist to tackle down those issues.
						</p><br>

						<h6>User Research</h6>
						<p>The aim of this project is to identify the limitations of public transportation as a main method for commuting and to propose an alternative or improved means of reliable transportation for low-income employees using affordable information technology. Our <span>interviews with the United Way, Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT), and a social impact entrepreneur </span>revealed the profile of low-income employees, public transit systems, and the current limitations in Michigan. Then, we investigated the factors of negative experience on public transportation through our <span>interviews with the passengers at Rosa Parks Transit Center</span> and the observation of the environment.</p>

			 		<p class="caption">Key findings from the interviews</p>

										
						<br><br>
						<h5>02. Finding a good solution</h5>
						<h6>Brainstorming with sketching</h6>
						<p>We brainstormed possible solutions by sketching ideas. Our first idea was to use public transportation cards’ remaining balances as donation fees. This idea originated from the London Oyster Card, which we decided to modify for the U.S context. The remaining money would go to low-income individuals who need transportation fares for his or her daily commuting.
						</p><br>
						<h6>Survey, Personas, and User Scenario</h6>
						<p>
						To understand donation and public transportation behavior, we surveyed 30 transit users. Based on collected data, we created personas and their user scenario to develop a refined solution.
						</p><br>

			 		<p class="caption">Survey questions and User scenario </p>
					<br><br>					
				

						<h5>03. Refining the solution (iterative design)</h5>
						<p>Although we started to design parts of our remaining balance donation system idea, we decided to change our solution because a donation system could only solve the 'public transportation fare' problem, but not our target audiences' other needs, such as their long commute times.  <br><br>

						We decided to define a commuter-matching, ride-sharing service as our solution. In this step, we brainstormed what features this application should have and what kind of technology is accessible for two different target users. We decided to use a mobile app technology tool for drivers and a website and text messaging system for low-income commuters. We wanted to make our design as accessible as possible, including those who have very limited data plans.

					<h5>04. Prototyping</h5>
					<h6>Digital Prototyping</h6>
						<p>After going through another brainstorming phase (Sketch, User Scenario) and building wireframes, we created a digital prototype.

				<h6>Usability Test</h6>
					<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our service and its value proposition, we conducted usability testing with target audiences.<br>
					The usability testing participants expressed concerns or curiosities about the methods of employment verification, payment transactions, and reward for drivers during the follow-up interviews. Some of the detailed comments on the specific features are about displaying a map of final route with pins that indicate the locations of stops or the passengers, profiles of
					passengers when showing the best matched results. There was also a new idea of the beacon stickers that can be detected via a mobile application, which may improve accessibility of the service for passengers with disabilities when tracking the location of their rides on the street. Through the usability testing of our service, we were able to improve our interface designs but the further research needs to be done for validation of users, safety, and sustainability.</p>

						<h4>OVERALL IMPACT</h4>
						<p>
						Uplift is expected to have the following impacts:<br>
						Improved transportation accessibility<br>
						Better transportation experience because users are verified and the rides are punctual<br>
						Reduced travel and wait time<br>
						Little to no learning curve (Uses existing technologies)<br>
						</p>

						<p>Uplift enhances transportation equity for low-income commuters in two ways:<br>
						1. Low-income people can use a ride sharing service without undue financial burden (same amount as a public transit fare), unlike existing ride sharing services.<br>
						2. Low-income commuters can experience better commuting by reducing wait and travel times.
						</p><br>

					<p>Drivers would be motivated to use Uplift for the following reasons:<br>
					1. They can be proud that their work improves their community. The app contains a feature drivers can use to check how much impact they are having on their community.<br>
					2. They can earn a small profit by driving for Uplift on their regular route to work.
