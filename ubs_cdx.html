			 			<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
			 			<p>UBS, known as one of the biggest wealth management firms in the U.S., wanted to bring more awareness of their banking services offering to their clients. As a part of their strategy for banking services opportunity, they wanted to include features for it into their wealth management mobile app and web.</p>

			 		</div>
			 		<div class="col-md-5">
			 			<h3>THE OUTCOME</h3>
			 			<p>We launched a banking hub page in the UBS Financial Services app, which is called “at a glance” under the banking services in the navigation. At a glance page is the one stop place where a user can manage cash-related tasks and view their total cash value; view recent activity, manage upcoming payments and transfers, etc.</p>

			 		<h4>DESIGN BRIEF</h4>
			 			<p>UBS wanted to enhance their clients’ digital experience since the clients were lacking self-service tools to plan for their financial future. Deloitte and UBS worked together for this mission, and did launch an iPad app in March of 2019. Using this groundwork, Deloitte pushed the experience to include additional tools and features for an enhanced iPhone release. One of the new features was banking hub where the clients could manage their banking related items efficiently. <br><br>On the banking hub page, called At a glance, a user could do:<br>
							1. Gain a comprehensive view of their cash across institutions <br>
							2. View upcoming payments & transfers<br>
							3. View recent cash & credit activity<br>
							4. Manage their credit cards<br>
							5. Transfer funds into a savings product </p>

						<h4>DESIGN PROCESS</h4>

						<h5>01. Research</h5>
						<h6>Generative Research</h6>
						<p>UBS and Deloitte conducted a qualitative research about how their clients view and manage their cash as a part of their wealth management. Based on this research, they came up with some features for cash management and conducted a testing to validate their concept.<br>

						From this research, we learned that there is a strong mental divide between cash for everyday transaction, and “savings & investment” (short-term needs vs. long-term needs). In addition, some participants for the testing expressed confusion of over what the exact offering was and what UBS made it different from a typical bank account.

						<h6>Competitive Analysis and Current Experience Audit</h6>
						<p>TWe conducted a competitive analysis to see how they positioned cash related service or product within their product, and what kind of cash management tools and features do they have. <br>

						From this analysis, we learned that segmenting financial needs in three different categories made most sense: investment, loan, cash; however, we found that current UBS app put cash in different category: cash balances and activities are live under investment section.</p>

						<h5>02. Ideation</h5>
						<h6>Information Architecture</h6>
						<p>After conducting these research, we built new information architecture to put cash management features in the right place within the UBS app in order to match it to a user’s mental model based on what we learned from research. One of the change we proposed was restructuring Accounts section. Dividing sections into three different categories in financial needs; Investments, Cash, Liabilities.
						<br>

						With new information architecture, we also demonstrated ideal view of home dashboard in the scenario that we introduced new features.

			 		<h6>Define the scope for MVP</h6>
						<p>Although UBS agreed that our proposal was ideal, they wanted to minize the restructuring of the current app because it would impact on the timline and cost for development. Instead of restructuring the app, <span>we decided to have separate experience under the banking services on navigation,</span> which is having one page aggregating cash management related features, and also decided to add the component on the dashboard so that a user can check their cash in handy and can go to this cash management feature aggregated page easily.

						</p><br>

				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
						<h5>03. Define Concept</h5>
						<h6>Feature ideation and exploring layout</h6>
						<p>Main features that came out from generative research phase were; total cash view, target cash level setting, banking offering, and upcoming bills & transfers. On top of that we brainstormed more about helpful features and thought about information hierachy within the page.
						</p>

					<h6>Design iteration with technical feasibility and business requirements</h6>
						<p>While iterating design, we had several meetings to gather technical feasibility and business requirements. Then, design had been changed based on these considerations; 1) UBS want to make this page more broader than cash management to embrace banking, 2) Some features can’t be implemented for MVP beause of technical issue, or business requirement. 
 					</p>
 					<br>
 					<h6>Layout exploration</h6>
						<p>With required features, we explored different layouts to make the page easy to scan and digest. The biggest design challenge for this page came out from total cash section on top of the page; how can we show categorized numbers clearly in limited space in the page. For example, total cash is consisted with UBS accounts and external accounts, and the amount of UBS accounts is consisted with the amount of cash available and cash alternative. Plus, we also had to display how many accounts made this total amount of cash. Since there are many information and numbers were tied into one data point, total cash, it was challenge to clearly display this hierachy so that a user can get information they are looking for easily and quickly. In order to achieve this, we explored different layouts.

						<h5>04. Design iteration and usertesting</h5>
						<h6>Design Iteration</h6>
						<p>While we had designed this banking hub experience at one page (Design A); displaying every information for cash and credits, we strongly felt that it should be separated into different page; cash vs. credit because we believed it would be more match with user’s mental model. Also, we wanted to make these pages more easy to scan by showing only high level information at first (Design B).

				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><br>
					<h6>1:1 in-person usertesting</h6>
						<p>We conducted 1:1 in-person usertesting with 10 paticipants to validate which version of design would more resonate to them, and to get feedbacks to improve design for each features.<br><br>

						From the testing, we found that most participants preferred the immediate representation of information in version B, but majority wanted some sort of combination of version A & B. Most also appreciated the summary view for recent cash & credit activity component.<br><br>

						With the result of usertesting, we had several discussion with UBS team, then we finalized our design for mobile; <span>due to time and technical constraints, we had to keep design A approach, but we could enhance the experience of this page by bringing summary view for some component.</span>

						<h4>IMPACT AND REFLECTION</h4>
						<p>UBS Financial Services iOS mobile app was launched in December 2019, including banking hub experience. This revamped app significantly increased digital engagement of UBS clients and this app was recognized as “intuitive, easily accessible, and modern” among the users. Especially for banking hub, we could hear that users love the summary view of upcoming payments & transfer, and recent cash & credit activity because they found that it is handy to check every upcoming their banking related activities.<br><br>

						Although we couldn’t implement the ideal state of banking experience onto MVP version due to several constraints, our findings and design ideas are still valid. Based on this fact, UBS and Deloitte team has kept making an effort to enhance banking experience.
